To develop the LMS within the 3-month timeline with a balanced team size, the following cost estimation is adjusted to fit within a budget of ₹11,00,000:

### Team Costs
1. **Frontend Developers** (2 Full-Time):
   - ₹40,000 per month × 3 months × 2 = ₹2,40,000
2. **Backend Developers** (2 Full-Time):
   - ₹1,10,000 per month × 3 months × 2 = ₹6,60,000
3. **AI/ML Engineer** (1 Part-Time):
   - ₹70,000 per month × 2 months = ₹1,40,000
4. **UI/UX Designer** (1 Part-Time):
   - ₹20,000 per month × 1 month = ₹20,000
5. **QA Engineers** (2 Part-Time):
   - ₹20,000 per month × 2 months × 2 = ₹80,000
6. **DevOps Engineer** (1 Part-Time):
   - ₹40,000 per month × 1 month = ₹40,000

### Total Estimated Development Cost
- **Team Costs**: ₹12,00,000-14,00,000

### Notes
- Infrastructure costs (e.g., cloud hosting, tools) are excluded from this budget and assumed to be managed separately.
